1. Fork, clone, and then `cd` into directory.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Below is the documentation for a used car sales business' API. Read through the api docs so that you know what types of requests you can make, and what responses you can expect. 

* Start with setting up **_1_** get, put, post, and delete request. If you have time or need more practice with http requests, set up the rest of the app.

NOTE: Your focus is on making the http requests using axios. You will notice that most of the app is already set up for you.

REMINDER: It is hard to dive into an existing code base and understand exactly what is going on. This project's focus is to help you learn how to interact with an API through http requests. It is not neccessary to understand each peice of this react app.

FOCUS:
  - How to make an http request using axios.
  - Understanding GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE
  - Using and understanding `.then()`

Bonus - notifications:
- This app is using a library called 'react-toasts'. You can have a toast show up in the corner to let you know if your http requests were successful or not.
- i.e.:
  ```
  axios.get('/api/vehicles')
  .then( res => {
    if (res.status === 200) {
      ToastStore.success('Success!', 3000)
    } else {
      ToastStore.error('Uh, oh! We got code issues!', 3000)
    }
  })
  
  ```
  success(message, timer) : green toast

  info(message, timer) : white toast

  warning(message, timer) : yellow toast

  error(message, timer) : red toast
